        Shalom Billing Services, LLC operates from Monday to Friday, 8:00 am to
        5:00 pm. An electronic record program is also mentioned as an
        alternative. All claims received by the company are logged as evidence
        of receipt, categorized by medical plans, coded, and data entered.
        Billing is conducted electronically, with manual processing and
        submission for specific cases. Once this process is complete, documents
        are archived. Clients receive payment explanations for all billed plans,
        and reconciliation of payments is the final phase. The 4% billing fee is
        based on this reconciliation.
